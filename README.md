The details of weather currently provided are :
* City Latitude,Longitude
* Weather condition
* Weather description
* Temperature(with Temp-min and Temp-max)
* Pressure and Humidity
* Rain(1h) and Rain(3h)

Currently I am trying to work on how to rotate and zoom the globe on the entered location marker for better user experience.
