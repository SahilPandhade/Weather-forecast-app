## Description

This web application will let you access weather statistics about a entered location.Not only that you also get a location marker marking the entered location on a globe which I built with Three.js.

1)City Latitude,Longitude
2)Weather condition
3)Weather description
4)Temperature(with Temp-min and Temp-max)
5)Pressure and Humidity
6)Rain(1h) and Rain(3h)
7)Clouds (all)

Currently I am trying to work on how to rotate and zoom the globe on the entered location marker for better user experience.
